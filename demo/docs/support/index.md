The Koin team is leading its development with open-source and community-driven approach since the beginning, and propose commercial services to secure your development.

## Releases Cycle

We drive our developments with release cycles of 6 months to follow Kotlin language and library updates in a consistent manner. We will use beta periods of 6 weeks or more, to help gather first feedbacks.

Once a new version is released, we start the Community support phase for 6 months minimum. During that phase, we are actively gathering feedbacks, following all updates impacting our framework, like librairies, Kotling Android, Ktor and others frameworks versions.

## Establishing Roadmap with Structured Versions 

The first big thing for the Koin project is organizing release cycles to establish a clear vision on versions deployment, and to help you anticipate updates and new features. We need a clear version tracking: `Major.Minor.Patch`

- Patch version: fixes only, minor dependency library updates
- Minor version: New features & deprecations
- Major features: New Impacting features, deprecations & hard breaking

We now drive our developments with release cycles of 6 months to follow Kotlin language and library updates in a consistent manner. We will use beta periods of 6 weeks to help gather first feedbacks.

## Enterprise Support by Kotzilla

Companies might struggle to follow the Koin release cycle for various reasons, including legal, business, or technical constraints.
As a result, when adopting a new technology, companies may require company-backed support and clear open-source license warranties.

For these reasons, Kotzilla has designated Koin 3.5.6 as our Long-Term Support version, as it is the most advanced and stable version of Koin for Kotlin 1.x.
We offer peace of mind until at least December 2025 by ensuring compatibility, code audits, and fast-track support for companies that need it.
