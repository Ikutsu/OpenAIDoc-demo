Koin Embedded is a new Koin project, targeting Android/Kotlin SDK & Library developers.

This project proposes scripts to help rebuild & package Koin project with a different package name. The interest is for SDK & Library development, to avoid conflict between embedded Koin version and any consuming application that would use another version of Koin, that might conflict.
