title: Get started with Kotlin Notebook

[Kotlin Notebook](kotlin-notebook-overview.md) is an interactive tool that lets you mix code, visuals, and markdown in one document. 
You can use notebooks to write and execute code in sections known as _code cells_, see the results instantly, and write down your thoughts. 
This setup makes it an excellent tool for rapid prototyping, analytics, and data science.
